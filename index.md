# Portfolio

Read the html, css, and javascript basics article listed and created this [website](https://aerusin.github.io/website/). The source code of the website is [here](https://github.com/aerusin/website/blob/main/index.html). I implemented some of the basics of html, css, and some javascript. 
# Changelog

* Added an image of my cat from my local directory.
* Created a list of groceries with the website embedded in the name.
* Made a background gradient, centered the image as well as rounding the edges to make it feel a bit more clean.
* Fiddled with an input text box where I wanted it to be able to change the color of text on screen based on what color was entered. Ended up deleting it as I swapped to a different idea which I will list below.
* After attending Dr. Barts lecture today, I tried to implement some javascript to change the color of the button when clicking on it but had some difficulty.
* Tried to create an animation based on a tutorial I found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) but had a bit of difficulty making the square go in a diamond shape which I origonally intended.
* 

# TODO

* Need to work on my function changeColor on click so that the color of the button will change once clicked.
* Need to fix the animation so that it doesnt break and goes in a diamond shape then proceedes to go back in the opposite direction with the colors going in reverse as well infinitely looping.
* I would like to try and soon work on making a calculator as well as a pig latin translator. A calculator is something ive always wanted to try and recreate so I could understand the fundamentals so I am excited to work on that.

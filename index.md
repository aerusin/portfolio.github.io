# Portfolio
Read [this](https://marksheet.io/) tutorial which went over the basics of HTML and CSS and created this [website](https://aerusin.github.io/website/). The source code of the website is [here](https://github.com/aerusin/website/blob/main/index.html). 

Watched a beginner website tutorial on youtube linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI&t=1575s&ab_channel=BrianDesign). I followed the guide a bit and created a [this](https://aerusin.github.io/website2/) website. The source code is [here](https://github.com/aerusin/website2/blob/main/index.html).

Made a game of tic-tac-toe from the react tutorial [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).


# Changelog
## Week 1
* Added an image of my cat from my local directory.
* Created a list of groceries with the website embedded in the name.
* Made a background gradient, centered the image as well as rounding the edges to make it feel a bit more clean.
* Fiddled with an input text box where I wanted it to be able to change the color of text on screen based on what color was entered. Ended up deleting it as I swapped to a different idea which I will list below.
* After attending Dr. Barts lecture today, I tried to implement some javascript to change the color of the button when clicking on it but had some difficulty.
* Tried to create an animation based on a tutorial I found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) but had a bit of difficulty making the square go in a diamond shape which I origonally intended.
## Week 2
* Fixed one of my TODO tasks from last week which was to fix my button so that it is able to change colors whenever it clicks. Read through [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) tutorial as well as I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTMOmRrqkU&t=1516s&ab_channel=devdojo) on javascript which helped me grasp a better understanding on how javascript works.
* Created a calculator in my origonal website which takes in two numbers from two different input boxes that adds/subtracts/multiplies/ or divides depending on the math symbol you choose in the dropdown box. It then computes the answer placing it in another box. I originally used document.write to display the answer but it would constantly refresh to a new page with the answer. I looked online for a bit of help and found [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-output-javascript-into-a-textbox) guide which helped me output my javascript to a textbox.
* Tried to create a page with full functionality of a dropdown menu box from a hamburger button but got a bit confused along the way with the process of everything merging together. I did learn a couple things from the tutorial such as a css selector called hover which can do things such as change the color of elements when hovered over.
* Followed the tutorial to create tic-tac-toe in react from the guide listed above and learned about the overall process of react and the idea of props as well as componenet states which allows a componenet to remember things such as being clicked
* Read this [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-bootstrap-4-grid-system-in-10-minutes-e83bfae115da/) that a student linked me as I was having a bit of trouble understanding the functionality of bootstrap and learned how much time bootstrap saves you and helps in terms of styling and overall layout.
* Started the inital creation of my calculator with function buttons and the ability to calculate many different numbers instead of just two.  

# TODO
## Week 1
* ~~Need to work on my function changeColor on click so that the color of the button will change once clicked.~~
* Need to fix the animation so that it doesnt break and goes in a diamond shape then proceedes to go back in the opposite direction with the colors going in reverse as well infinitely looping.
* ~~I would like to try and soon work on making a calculator as well as a pig latin translator. A calculator is something ive always wanted to try and recreate so I could understand the fundamentals so I am excited to work on that.~~
## Week 2
* Plan on upscaling my calculator from two text box inputs to an actual clickable calculator that can calculate many different numbers. Will also work on making it look like an actual calculator in terms of structure, shape and colors. Really want to also add the ability to click a button and have window open where the calculator will also take in written problems instead of just entered through pushing buttons.
